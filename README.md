### Profile Summary

You may know about me and my skills down here.

I am a proficient researcher and a profund coder (mainly in **C/C++**). 

I enjoy **devicing algorithms** in order to solve challenging problems that require **critical problem-solving** and **programming skills**.

At present I am working as a **Research Associate** in the **Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Madras, India**. 

Below are major works in which I have contributed as a coder/researcher. In all these projects I majorly coded in C++.

#### 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, I am working on mathematical modeling of **auto-rotation based UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)** in the **Venusian Atmosphere**, under the project 

**"Feasibility Studies and Preliminary Aerodynamic Design of Autorotation based Venus Descent System"**

being funded by **ISRO** (Indian Space Research Organisation).

#### 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before this, as a project associate, I implemented a **non-linear optimization technique (IPOPT)** in C++ to optimize the shape of the rotor of the **Rotor-Craft UAV** meant to ascent in the **Martian atmosphere** to increase thrust by power ratio of the rotor blade system, under the project  

**"Development of Rotor-Craft UAV for Operation in Martian Atmosphere."** 

being funded by **ISRO** (Indian Space Research Organisation).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a research intern, I had previously worked on project
 
**" Development of n-Layered Color QR Codes with Increased Capacity and Security"**

in **IIIT Delhi** (Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology).

In which I worked on the following:

3.1 Designed techniques to **enhance the data capacity and security of graphical codes** that find application in **Digital Forensics**.

3.2  Developed algorithms tp increase the capacity of conventional B&W QR codes by **4 times** to form a **generalized framework for n layered Color QR code**.

3.3 The proposed framework solved the problem of **color shifting and classification** in addition to the **realization of the entire Print&Scan process** which significantly enhanced the **document fraud detection and authentication rates**.

I have worked on **Image Processing Unit of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)** under a student competition in undergrads named as **Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems international (AUVSI)**, **Student Unmanned Aerial Systems Competition (SUAS)**.

Our work secured **25th rank Internationally** in the competition held in Maryland, USA. I contributed in the following manner:

4.1 I Implemented a solution that **automated detection, localization, and classification of ground objects** for an Unmanned Autonomous RC Plane. I had used **OpenCV with C++** as an image processing tool. The **SVM classifier** was being used to classify the detected shapes as per competition rules.

Team Name: **Zeppelin FC-26** 
Year: 2006
